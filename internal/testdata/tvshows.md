# TV Shows

A list of TV shows I enjoyed watching:

- [The Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire)

    > *The Wire* Focuses on the ongoing war between the police and
    > drug-dealing gangs in Baltimore. Each season shifts its focus, starting
    > with the drug trade in the projects, then expanding to include the
    > ports, the education system, city politics, and the media. The show
    > highlights the challenges and failures of institutions and how systemic
    > issues like poverty, corruption, and bureaucracy affect both the cops
    > and the criminals. It presents a raw and realistic portrayal of the
    > urban decay and the often futile efforts to make things better.

- [The Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shield)

    > *The Shield* follows the story of Detective Vic Mackey and his corrupt
    > anti-gang unit in the Los Angeles Police Department. The show explores
    > moral ambiguity as Mackey and his team use illegal tactics to fight
    > crime, often becoming as ruthless as the criminals they're pursuing. The
    > line between good and evil blurs as Mackey justifies his actions in the
    > name of justice, leading to personal and professional consequences.

- [OZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_(TV_series))

    > *Oz* is set in the Oswald State Penitentiary, a maximum-security prison.
    > The show focuses on the experimental "Emerald City" unit, which tries to
    > rehabilitate inmates rather than just punish them. The series delves
    > into the brutal lives of prisoners, with power struggles, gang violence,
    > corruption, and attempts at reform. It paints a grim picture of life
    > behind bars, where survival often means compromising one's morality.

- [The Sopranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos)

    > *The Sopranos* centers on Tony Soprano, a New Jersey mob boss, as he
    > juggles the pressures of running a criminal organization and managing
    > his personal and family life. Tony seeks therapy to deal with panic
    > attacks, and through these sessions, the show explores his internal
    > struggles with his role as a leader, father, and husband. It's a deep
    > dive into the psychology of a gangster, blending crime drama with dark
    > humor.

- [Breaking Bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad)

    > *Breaking Bad* follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher
    > diagnosed with terminal cancer, who turns to cooking methamphetamine to
    > secure his family's financial future. Partnering with a former student,
    > Jesse Pinkman, Walter descends into the criminal underworld. Over time,
    > his transformation from a mild-mannered teacher to a ruthless drug
    > kingpin, known as Heisenberg, raises questions about morality, ambition,
    > and the consequences of choices.

- [Justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justified_(TV_series))

    > *Justified* is about U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, who is transferred back
    > to his hometown in rural Kentucky after a controversial shooting. The
    > show focuses on Raylan's enforcement of justice in Harlan County, where
    > old friends and foes from his past, particularly the criminal Boyd
    > Crowder, complicate his work. The series blends crime, action, and
    > character drama, exploring loyalty, family, and law enforcement in a
    > place where justice is often "justified" by personal motives.

- [Band of Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries))

    > *Band of Brothers* is a miniseries based on the true story of Easy
    > Company, part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment in the U.S.
    > Army's 101st Airborne Division during World War II. The show chronicles
    > their experiences from training in the U.S. through major battles in
    > Europe, including D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge. It emphasizes the
    > bond between the soldiers, the horrors of war, and the personal toll it
    > takes on each man.
